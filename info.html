                <h4>AI-as-a-service</h4>
                            <h4 class="subheading">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is one of the most transformative tech evolutions of our times.</h4>
            <p >As I highlighted in my book 'Artificial Intelligence in Practice', most companies have started to explore how they can use AI to improve the customer experience and to streamline their business operations. This will continue in 2020, and while people will increasingly become used to working alongside AIs, designing and deploying our own AI-based systems will remain an expensive proposition for most businesses.</p>

                <h4>5G data networks</h4>
                            <h4 class="subheading">The 5th generation of mobile internet connectivity is going to give us super-fast download and upload speeds as well as more stable connections.</h4>
                            <p >While 5G mobile data networks became available for the first time in 2019, they were mostly still expensive and limited to functioning in confined areas or major cities. 2020 is likely to be the year when 5G really starts to fly, with more affordable data plans as well as greatly improved coverage, meaning that everyone can join in the fun.</p>

                            <p >Our ability to capture data from wearable devices such as smartwatches will give us the ability to increasingly predict and treat health issues in people even before they experience any symptoms. </p>

                <h4>Autonomous Driving</h4>
                            <h4 class="subheading">While we still aren’t at the stage where we can expect to routinely travel in, or even see, autonomous vehicles in 2020, they will undoubtedly continue to generate a significant amount of excitement.</h4>
                            <p >Tesla chief Elon Musk has said he expects his company to create a truly “complete” autonomous vehicle by this year, and the number of vehicles capable of operating with a lesser degree of autonomy – such as automated braking and lane-changing – will become an increasingly common sight. In addition to this, other in-car systems not directly connected to driving, such as security and entertainment functions – will become increasingly automated and reliant on data capture and analytics.</p>
